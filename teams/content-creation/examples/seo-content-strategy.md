## Project Charter Inputs

- **Budget**: Content team only (no paid ads in this scope)

- **Existing content**: 3 product pages, 1 about page, no blog

## Team Execution

### Phase 1: SEO Research (Research Specialist + Coordinator)

### Phase 2: Strategy Architecture (Coordinator + Content Drafter)

- Content type mix: how-to guides (40%), comparisons (25%), listicles (20%), deep dives (15%)
- Publication cadence: 2-3 articles per week for first 3 months

### Phase 3: Priority Content (Content Drafter + Humanizer)
- Write first 10 articles targeting highest-opportunity keywords
- Focus on long-tail keywords (lower difficulty, higher conversion intent)
- Include product mentions naturally (not forced)
- Each article: 1500-2500 words, optimized for featured snippets
- Output: 10 publication-ready articles

### Phase 4: Review & Optimize (Fact Checker + Format Specialist + Content Critic)
