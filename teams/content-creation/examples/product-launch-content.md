# Example: Product Launch Content Package

## Scenario

A startup is launching a new AI meal planning app and needs a complete content package: landing page copy, launch email sequence, social media posts, and press release.

## Project Charter Inputs

- **Product**: MealPlan AI — AI-powered weekly meal planning for busy parents
- **Launch date**: 3 weeks out
- **Pricing**: $8.99/month
- **Target**: Time-starved parents (25-45), dual-income households
- **Positioning**: "Dinner sorted in 5 minutes" — convenience-first
- **Channels**: Website, email, Instagram, LinkedIn, Product Hunt

## Team Execution

### Phase 1: Research & Strategy
- Research competitor launch messaging (HelloFresh, Mealime, PlateJoy)
- Analyze target audience language from parenting forums and social media
- Define messaging hierarchy: primary value prop → supporting claims → proof points
- Output: Messaging framework document

### Phase 2: Core Copy
- Landing page copy (hero, features, social proof, pricing, FAQ, CTA)
- Product Hunt launch post (tagline, description, maker comment)
- Press release (newsworthy angle, quotes, boilerplate)
- Output: 3 core documents

### Phase 3: Email Sequence
- Pre-launch teaser (sent 7 days before)
- Launch announcement (launch day)
- Feature highlight (day 3)
- Social proof / early results (day 7)
- Last chance / urgency (day 14)
- Output: 5 email drafts with subject lines and preview text

### Phase 4: Social Media
- 10 Instagram posts (carousel and single image captions)
- 5 LinkedIn posts (founder story, behind-the-scenes, launch announcement)
- 3 Twitter/X threads (problem → solution, launch story, customer story)
- Output: Social media content calendar with copy

### Review & Polish
- All content reviewed for brand voice consistency
- Fact-check claims (speed claims, comparison claims)
- Format for each platform's requirements
- Output: Final content package
