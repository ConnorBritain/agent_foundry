## Scenario Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Priority** | High |
| **Research Mode** | Market/Competitive |
| **Validated After** | Phase 4 |
| **Primary Agents** | Lead Researcher, Source Analyst, Data Synthesizer, Fact Checker, Report Writer |
| **Estimated Duration** | ~90-120 minutes (hybrid mode) |
| **Estimated Cost** | ~$25-45 (default config) |

---

## Context

A company is considering expanding into an adjacent market vertical. Leadership needs defensible data to make a go/no-go investment decision. The research must produce a TAM/SAM/SOM model with documented assumptions, a competitive landscape map, key risk factors, and a strategic recommendation with supporting evidence.

## Trigger

User provides a research brief specifying:
- The target vertical and geographic scope
- The company's current capabilities and customer base
- Budget range for the potential investment
- Timeline for the entry decision
- Specific questions leadership needs answered

## Team Configuration

| Agent | Role in This Scenario |
|-------|----------------------|
| Lead Researcher | Decomposes the market entry question into sub-questions: market size, growth drivers, competitive intensity, customer segments, barriers to entry, regulatory landscape |
| Source Analyst | Discovers industry reports, financial filings, analyst estimates, government data, and competitor information |
| Data Synthesizer | Builds the TAM/SAM/SOM model, integrates competitive findings, constructs trend analysis |
| Fact Checker | Verifies all market size figures, growth rates, and competitor claims against primary sources |
| Report Writer | Produces the market analysis report, executive briefing, and TAM/SAM/SOM model document |

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Research Design (~15 min)
- Lead Researcher decomposes the market entry question into 5-7 sub-questions
- Defines the market boundaries (what is included and excluded)
- Identifies required data sources: industry reports, government statistics, financial filings, competitor websites
- Establishes success criteria: defensible TAM/SAM/SOM, competitive landscape with 5+ competitors, identified barriers to entry

### Phase 2: Data Collection (~30-40 min)
- Source Analyst executes systematic search across web, news, and industry databases
- Gathers market size estimates from multiple independent sources
- Collects competitor data: pricing, positioning, funding, team size, customer segments
- Identifies regulatory requirements and compliance costs
- Documents research gaps and contested market figures

### Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis (~25-35 min)
- Lead Researcher integrates findings across sub-questions and identifies patterns
- Data Synthesizer builds dual-approach TAM/SAM/SOM model (top-down and bottom-up)
- Data Synthesizer maps competitive landscape: positioning, strengths, gaps
- Data Synthesizer identifies 3-5 key market trends with supporting evidence
- Fact Checker verifies all statistical claims and market figures

### Phase 4: Deliverable Production (~20-30 min)
- Report Writer produces comprehensive market analysis report
- Report Writer creates standalone executive briefing (2-3 pages)
- Report Writer documents TAM/SAM/SOM model with all assumptions
- Lead Researcher reviews all deliverables for analytical rigor
- Coordinator performs final quality gate review

## Expected Outputs

| Deliverable | Format | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Market analysis report | Markdown (15-25 pages) | Comprehensive analysis: market overview, sizing, competition, trends, risks |
| Executive briefing | Markdown (2-3 pages) | Standalone summary for leadership with go/no-go recommendation |
| TAM/SAM/SOM model | Markdown with tables | Dual-approach market sizing with documented assumptions and sensitivity analysis |
| Competitive landscape | Markdown with tables | Competitor profiles, positioning map, feature comparison, pricing analysis |
| Source database | Markdown table | All sources with credibility assessments and access links |

## Estimated Cost

| Phase | Agent(s) | Est. Tokens | Est. Cost |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Research Design | Lead Researcher | ~30K | ~$4.50 |
| Data Collection | Source Analyst | ~80K | ~$4.80 |
| Analysis & Synthesis | Lead Researcher + Data Synthesizer + Fact Checker | ~120K | ~$7.50 |
| Deliverable Production | Report Writer + Lead Researcher | ~80K | ~$5.00 |
| **Total** | | **~310K** | **~$22-35** |

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] TAM/SAM/SOM uses both top-down and bottom-up approaches with reconciliation
- [ ] All market size figures cite primary sources (analyst reports, government data, financial filings)
- [ ] Competitive landscape includes 5+ competitors with consistent evaluation criteria
- [ ] Key assumptions are documented and sensitivity analysis shows impact of changing them
- [ ] Recommendations are specific, actionable, and linked to evidence
- [ ] Limitations are honestly documented (data gaps, estimation uncertainty)
