## How the Team Adapts for Enterprise

### Coordinator designs a high-touch motion:
- Named account strategy (target 200 specific companies)
- Multi-threaded selling (engage 3-5 stakeholders per deal)
- Custom content per vertical (banking, insurance, asset management)
- Event-driven pipeline (conferences, roundtables, webinars)

### Demand Generation focuses on:
- **Account-Based Marketing (ABM)**: LinkedIn ads targeting specific companies
- **Executive content**: Whitepapers, industry reports, regulatory update briefings
- **Events**: Compliance conference sponsorships, executive roundtables
- **Outbound**: Personalized sequences to CCOs at target accounts
- Low volume, high quality — 30 MQLs/month, not 300

### Sales Enablement creates enterprise-grade materials:
- **Executive pitch deck**: Board-level, focuses on risk reduction and regulatory exposure
- **Security & compliance documentation**: SOC 2, GDPR, data residency, encryption
- **Custom ROI model**: Input: current compliance team size, audit costs, regulatory fines risk → output: 3-year TCO comparison
- **Reference architecture**: How ComplianceOS integrates with existing GRC stack
- **Procurement package**: MSA template, DPA, SLA, vendor questionnaire responses

### Pipeline Manager adapts stages for long cycles:
```
Lead → Research → Outreach → Discovery → Champion Identified →
Technical Evaluation → Security Review → Business Case →
Procurement → Legal Review → Contract Negotiation → Closed Won
```

- Each stage has exit criteria (e.g., "Champion Identified" requires: named internal sponsor who has budget influence and expressed urgency)
- Deal velocity tracking by stage (where do deals stall?)
- Multi-threading score: deals with 3+ contacts close 2.5x more often

### Customer Success designs enterprise onboarding:
- **Implementation project plan**: 90-day rollout with dedicated CSM
- **Executive sponsor program**: Quarterly C-level check-ins
- **Expansion playbook**: Start with one business unit, expand to others
- **QBR framework**: Compliance posture improvement, audit readiness, ROI delivered

### Growth Analyst focuses on:
- Win/loss analysis: Why do we win? Why do we lose? To whom?
- Deal velocity optimization: Identify and fix stage-level bottlenecks
- Account scoring: Propensity model for target account prioritization
- Competitive intelligence: Feature comparison, pricing intelligence, switching cost analysis

## Enterprise Sales Metrics

| Metric | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Target accounts engaged | 40 | 80 | 120 | 160 |
| SQLs | 8 | 15 | 22 | 30 |
| Active opportunities | 5 | 12 | 20 | 28 |
| Deals closed | 1 | 3 | 5 | 8 |
| ACV | $75K | $90K | $100K | $110K |

| Win rate | 20% | 25% | 28% | 30% |
| Avg sales cycle | 210 days | 180 days | 165 days | 150 days |

## Key Differences from SMB

| Aspect | SMB/PLG | Enterprise |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Volume | High (1000s) | Low (100s) |
| Touch | Low/no-touch | High-touch |
| Content | Blog posts, tutorials | Whitepapers, custom decks |
| Sales cycle | 7-30 days | 90-270 days |
| Decision maker | Individual | Committee (3-7 people) |
| Pricing | Published, self-serve | Custom, negotiated |
| Procurement | Credit card | Legal review, MSA, SOW |
| CAC | $50-500 | $10K-50K |
| LTV | $1K-10K | $200K-$1M+ |
| Success metric | Activation rate | Pipeline value |

## Cost: ~$120

Higher than SMB/PLG due to the depth of enterprise-grade materials (security docs, procurement packages, custom ROI models) and the complexity of the ABM strategy.
