# Scenario: Product Launch Campaign

Planning and executing a coordinated product launch campaign across paid, organic, and sales channels for a B2B SaaS feature release.

---

## Context

A B2B SaaS company is launching a major new feature (AI-powered analytics dashboard) that represents a significant upgrade to their platform. The launch needs to generate awareness, drive trial activations, and arm the sales team with enablement materials — all within a 6-week window.

## Trigger

- Product team confirms GA date (6 weeks out)
- Marketing leadership approves $25K launch budget
- Sales team requests enablement materials for pipeline acceleration

## Team Configuration

|-------|-----------------|
| Coordinator | Orchestrates launch timeline and cross-agent dependencies |
| Brand-Messaging | Develops launch messaging, positioning, and creative direction |
| Demand-Generation | Plans paid campaigns, email sequences, and landing pages |
| Sales-Enablement | Creates sales decks, battle cards, and demo scripts |
| Customer-Success | Plans existing customer migration, upsell communications |
| Growth-Analyst | Sets KPIs, builds tracking framework, designs A/B tests |
| Pipeline-Manager | Forecasts pipeline impact and tracks launch-to-revenue metrics |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Messaging & Strategy (Brand-Messaging + Growth-Analyst)
- Define the launch narrative: problem → solution → differentiation → proof
- Create positioning statement for the new feature
- Develop messaging variants for different personas (technical, executive, end-user)
- Set launch KPIs: awareness (impressions, CTR), activation (signups, trials), revenue (pipeline, closed-won)
- **Output**: Launch messaging guide, KPI framework

### Phase 2: Campaign Planning (Demand-Generation + Growth-Analyst)
- Design multi-channel campaign: LinkedIn ads, Google ads, email nurture, webinar
- Allocate $25K budget across channels based on historical CAC data
- Create landing page wireframe and copy

- Build ROI calculator for the new feature
- Forecast pipeline impact: expected leads, conversion rates, revenue contribution
- **Output**: Sales enablement kit, pipeline forecast model

### Phase 4: Customer Communications (Customer-Success + Brand-Messaging)
- Segment existing customer base by feature fit
- Draft tiered communications: power users (early access), active users (announcement), dormant users (re-engagement)
- Plan in-app notification sequence
- Create upsell talk track for customer success team
- **Output**: Customer communication plan, in-app messaging spec

### Phase 5: Launch Execution & Tracking (All Agents)
- Compile master launch checklist with T-minus timeline
- Finalize all creative assets and copy
