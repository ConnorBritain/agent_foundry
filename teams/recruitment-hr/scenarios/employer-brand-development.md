# Scenario: Employer Brand & EVP Development

Building a compelling employer brand and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) from scratch for a growing startup that needs to differentiate itself in a competitive talent market.

---

## Context

A Series A startup (45 employees) is struggling to attract senior engineering talent. They lose candidates to larger companies with established brands. The founding team recognizes they need a formalized employer brand and EVP to compete, but have never built one before.

## Trigger

- Offer acceptance rate below 40% for senior roles
- Candidate feedback cites "never heard of you" as top concern
- Competitors with similar compensation are winning candidates

## Team Configuration

| Agent | Role in Scenario |
|-------|-----------------|
| Coordinator | Orchestrates the EVP development process across all agents |
| Culture-Engagement | Leads internal culture audit, identifies authentic differentiators |
| Talent-Acquisition | Provides candidate feedback data, maps competitor employer brands |
| Compensation-Benefits | Benchmarks total rewards against competitors |
| Onboarding-Enablement | Documents the employee experience journey |
| Performance-Management | Provides retention and satisfaction data |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Internal Audit (Culture-Engagement + Performance-Management)
- Survey existing employees on why they joined and why they stay
- Identify authentic culture differentiators (not aspirational, actual)
- Analyze retention data by team, tenure, and role level
- Map the employee experience from interview through year 2
- **Output**: Culture audit report with validated differentiators

### Phase 2: External Benchmarking (Talent-Acquisition + Compensation-Benefits)
- Audit competitor employer brands (careers pages, Glassdoor, LinkedIn)
- Map competitor EVP pillars and messaging themes
- Benchmark compensation, benefits, and perks
- Analyze candidate rejection reasons and competitor win patterns
- **Output**: Competitive employer brand landscape report

### Phase 3: EVP Framework (Coordinator + Culture-Engagement)
- Synthesize internal and external findings into EVP pillars
- Draft 4-5 EVP pillars (e.g., "Build what matters", "Grow without limits")
- Create messaging framework: headline, proof points, stories per pillar
- Develop tone of voice guide for employer brand communications
- **Output**: EVP framework document with messaging guide

### Phase 4: Activation Plan (All Agents)
- Careers page copy and structure recommendations
- Job description templates aligned to EVP
- Interview process improvements to reinforce brand
- Social media content calendar (LinkedIn, X)
- Onboarding updates to deliver on EVP promises from day one
- **Output**: Employer brand activation playbook

## Expected Outputs

- Culture audit report
- Competitive employer brand landscape
- EVP framework with 4-5 pillars
- Messaging guide with proof points
- Employer brand activation playbook
- Updated job description templates
- Careers page content recommendations
