# Scenario: Hire to Productive

An end-to-end walkthrough of the complete hiring journey -- from the moment a team requests a new hire through the point where that hire reaches full productivity. This scenario demonstrates how all six agents collaborate to move a single person through the entire employee lifecycle.

---

## Context

**Company:** A 45-person B2B SaaS startup, Series B, growing revenue 3x year-over-year. The engineering team (currently 18 people) needs a Senior Backend Engineer to own a critical new integrations platform. The VP of Engineering submitted the headcount request three weeks ago. Leadership approved it last week.

**Stakes:** This hire will own the integrations platform that connects to the company's top 10 enterprise customers. A mis-hire delays the product roadmap by a quarter. A slow onboarding costs $2,000+ per day in lost productivity. Getting this right is a business-critical event.

---

## Phase 1: Role Definition and Pipeline Preparation

**Timeline:** Days 1-5

### Coordinator Actions

The Coordinator receives the headcount request and translates business need into people strategy:

- Validates the role against the headcount plan and budget (approved for Q2, $180-210K base + equity)
- Defines the role's position in the org chart: reports to the Engineering Manager for Platform, collaborates with the API team and Solutions Engineering
- Sets urgency and priority: critical hire, target 30 days to offer
- Triggers the Talent Acquisition Specialist to begin and notifies Compensation & Benefits to prepare the offer framework

### Talent Acquisition Actions

The Talent Acquisition Specialist designs the role and interview process:

**Job Description Created:**
- Role: Senior Backend Engineer, Integrations Platform
- Why it exists: Enterprise customers need reliable, scalable integrations. This person will own the architecture and delivery of the integrations layer.
- 30-day expectation: Understand the codebase, ship a small integration enhancement
- 60-day expectation: Own one major integration end-to-end
- 90-day expectation: Define the integrations platform roadmap, mentor junior engineers on integration patterns
- Compensation: $180-210K base + equity (0.08-0.15% fully diluted)
- Required: 5+ years backend development, experience with API design and third-party integrations, comfort with ambiguity
- Nice-to-have: Experience with the company's tech stack (Go, PostgreSQL, AWS), enterprise SaaS background

**Interview Process Designed:**
- Stage 1: Phone Screen (30 min) -- Motivation, career narrative, basic qualification check
- Stage 2: Technical Assessment (90 min) -- System design exercise focused on integration architecture, code review of a real pull request
- Stage 3: Team Interview (60 min) -- Cross-functional collaboration scenarios, values alignment, working style
- Stage 4: Engineering Leadership Interview (30 min) -- Strategic thinking, long-term alignment, candidate questions

**Scorecards Created:**
- Each stage has specific competencies being evaluated, with 1-5 rating scales and behavioral anchors at each level
- Red flags defined: dismissive of testing, cannot explain past failures, talks only about individual work
- Green flags defined: asks thoughtful questions about the product, talks about mentoring, has opinions on API design with reasoning

### Compensation & Benefits Actions

The Compensation & Benefits Analyst prepares the offer framework:

- Benchmarks "Senior Backend Engineer" in the company's market (Series B, Tier 1 geography): median base $195K, 75th percentile $215K
- Proposes salary band: $180-210K with midpoint at $195K
- Proposes equity range: 0.08-0.15% fully diluted (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)
- Prepares total rewards summary for candidate selling: base + equity + benefits = $250-310K total estimated compensation
- Notes: current team median for Senior Backend Engineers is $192K -- new hire should not exceed $210K without Coordinator approval to maintain internal equity

## Phase 2: Sourcing and Screening

**Timeline:** Days 5-20

### Talent Acquisition Actions

**Sourcing Strategy Executed:**

The Talent Acquisition Specialist activates multiple channels simultaneously:

| Channel | Activity | Results |

| Lever posting (inbound) | Published to company careers page, LinkedIn, and 3 targeted job boards | 72 applications |
| Direct outreach | Identified and messaged 45 engineers at companies with strong integrations platforms | 18 responded, 12 interested |
| Employee referrals | Asked the engineering team "Who is the best integrations engineer you have worked with?" | 8 referrals submitted |
| Community sourcing | Posted in 3 relevant Slack communities and 2 engineering forums | 15 expressions of interest |
| Recruiting agency (backup) | Briefed one specialist agency as insurance | 12 profiles submitted |

**Total candidates reviewed: 150**

**Phone Screen Results (20 candidates screened):**

The Talent Acquisition Specialist selects the top 20 candidates based on resume review, portfolio examination, and outreach responses. Phone screens are scheduled within 48 hours of candidate expressing interest.

| Outcome | Count | Common Reasons |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Advanced to technical | 12 | Strong technical background, clear motivation, values-aligned |
| Rejected | 6 | Overqualified and likely to leave quickly (2), underqualified for senior level (2), red flags in motivation (2) |
| Redirected to other role | 2 | Strong candidates but better fit for open mid-level backend role |

**Candidate communication standards maintained:**
- Every applicant received an acknowledgment within 24 hours
- Rejected candidates received a personalized response within 5 business days
- Candidates advancing received next-stage details within 48 hours

### Full Interview Loop Results (8 candidates)

Of 12 candidates who advanced to the technical round, 8 completed the full interview loop (4 withdrew: 2 accepted other offers, 1 decided to stay at current company, 1 had scheduling conflicts that could not be resolved).

| Candidate | Phone Screen | Technical | Team Interview | Leadership | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Candidate A | 4.5/5 | 4.8/5 | 4.5/5 | 4.7/5 | Strong Hire |
| Candidate B | 4.0/5 | 4.5/5 | 4.2/5 | 4.0/5 | Hire |
| Candidate C | 4.2/5 | 3.8/5 | 4.5/5 | 4.0/5 | Lean Hire |
| Candidate D | 3.8/5 | 4.0/5 | 3.5/5 | 3.8/5 | No Hire (values misalignment) |
| Candidate E | 4.0/5 | 3.2/5 | 4.0/5 | 3.5/5 | No Hire (technical gap) |
| Candidate F | 3.5/5 | 4.2/5 | 3.0/5 | 3.2/5 | No Hire (collaboration concerns) |
| Candidate G | 4.0/5 | 3.5/5 | 3.8/5 | 3.5/5 | No Hire (borderline, prefer to wait) |
| Candidate H | 3.8/5 | 3.0/5 | 3.5/5 | 3.0/5 | No Hire (not senior-level scope) |

**Decision:** Extend offers to Candidate A (first choice) and Candidate B (backup if A declines).

## Lessons Captured

**What worked well:**
- Pre-boarding communication eliminated Day 1 anxiety. The new hire said: "I felt expected and prepared, not lost."
- The first small task (PR review on Day 1) made the new hire feel like a contributor immediately, not a tourist.
- The buddy relationship was strong. Having someone to ask "dumb questions" without judgment accelerated ramp significantly.
- Transparent offer process built trust from the start. No negotiation games, no lowball-then-adjust.

**What to improve:**
- Development environment setup took 3 hours instead of the planned 1 hour. Two tools had changed since the setup guide was last updated. The Onboarding team will refresh setup documentation monthly.
- The new hire had a 4-day gap between accepting the offer and receiving the first pre-boarding communication. The target is same-day or next-day. The Onboarding team will automate the welcome trigger.
- Cross-functional introductions were concentrated in Week 1, but the new hire said they did not remember most of them until they actually needed to work with those people. Consider spreading introductions over the first month, tied to actual project context.

**Data fed back to agents:**
- **Talent Acquisition:** Source effectiveness data (this hire came from direct outreach, confirming it as the highest-quality channel for senior engineering)
- **Onboarding:** Day 30 and Day 90 survey verbatims for program iteration
- **Performance Management:** Initial OKR quality assessment and first-quarter trajectory
- **Compensation:** Offer was accepted without negotiation, confirming the band is competitive. No internal equity issues flagged.
- **Culture:** New hire engagement score of 9/10 at 90 days suggests strong cultural integration
- **Coordinator:** Full pipeline metrics added to quarterly people review dashboard
