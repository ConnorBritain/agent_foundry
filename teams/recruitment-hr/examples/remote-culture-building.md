# Example: Remote Culture Building — 25-Person Distributed Team

## Project Overview

"DataFlow" is a fully remote, 25-person data infrastructure startup spread across 4 time zones (US Pacific, US Eastern, UK, India). They need to build intentional culture without a physical office.

## Configuration

```yaml
company_stage: series_a
current_headcount: 25
target_headcount: 25  # Focus on culture, not hiring
hiring_timeline_months: 0
culture:
  values: [trust, clarity, impact, kindness]
  work_model: remote
  meeting_culture: async_first
tools:
  engagement: lattice
```

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Coordinator defines remote culture principles:
1. **Async-first**: Default to written communication. Meetings require agendas and artifacts.
2. **Overlap windows**: 4 hours of shared availability (9am-1pm ET) for synchronous work
3. **Trust by default**: Judge output, not online status. No surveillance tools.
4. **Intentional connection**: Social interaction doesn't happen naturally — design it.

### Culture & Engagement designs the framework:

**Company Values — Operationalized for Remote:**

| Value | What it means | Remote behavior | Anti-pattern |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Trust | We assume good intent | No "just checking in" status pings | Micromanaging online hours |
| Clarity | We write things down | Every decision has a written artifact | Verbal-only decisions in DMs |
| Impact | We measure outcomes | Weekly wins shared async | Measuring hours worked |
| Kindness | We support each other | "How are you really?" in 1:1s | Skipping human connection |

## Phase 2: Rituals & Rhythms

### Culture & Engagement designs the ritual calendar:

**Daily:**
- Async standup in Slack (bot posts at 9am local): "What I did / What I'm doing / Any blockers"
- No mandatory daily meetings

**Weekly:**
- Monday kickoff (async): Team leads post priorities for the week
- Wednesday social (optional, 30 min): Rotating themes — show your workspace, pet intros, hobby shares
- Friday demo (live, 45 min, recorded): Each team demos what they shipped

**Monthly:**
- All-hands (live, 60 min): CEO update, team spotlights, Q&A
- Virtual coffee roulette: Random 1:1 pairings across teams (15 min)
- Retrospective: "What should we start/stop/continue?"

**Quarterly:**
- Virtual offsite (half-day): Strategy review + team building activity
- Engagement pulse survey (5 questions, anonymous)
- Peer recognition awards: Team votes on "Impact Award" and "Kindness Award"

**Annually:**
- In-person retreat: 3 days, location rotates. Non-negotiable budget item.
- Annual engagement survey (comprehensive)
- Culture refresh: Review and update values if needed

### Onboarding & Enablement designs remote-first onboarding:

**Pre-start:**
- Equipment shipped 1 week early (laptop, monitor, headset, webcam)
- Welcome package mailed (swag, handwritten note from manager, team photo)
- Slack access enabled day before — #new-hires channel welcomes them

**Day 1:**
- 1:1 with manager (30 min): Expectations, communication norms, first week plan
- Virtual team lunch (everyone orders delivery on company card)
- "Scavenger hunt": Find 10 things in the wiki (teaches navigation)

**Week 1:**
- 15-minute 1:1s with everyone on their team
- Buddy assigned (different team, similar tenure) — weekly casual chats for 3 months
- Complete first small task and ship it

**Month 1:**
- Coffee chats with 5 people outside their team
- Present at Friday demo (even something small)
- Feedback session with manager: "How's remote life here?"

## Phase 3: Feedback & Measurement

### Culture & Engagement implements:

**Pulse Survey (Monthly, 5 questions):**
1. "I feel connected to my teammates" (1-10)
2. "I have the information I need to do my job" (1-10)
3. "I feel comfortable raising concerns" (1-10)
4. "I feel recognized for my work" (1-10)
5. "Would you recommend DataFlow as a workplace?" (eNPS: 0-10)

**Tracking Dashboard:**
| Metric | Baseline | Month 3 | Month 6 | Target |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| eNPS | 25 | 38 | 45 | 40+ |
| Connection score | 6.2 | 7.5 | 8.1 | 8+ |
| Info access score | 5.8 | 7.8 | 8.5 | 8+ |
| Psych safety score | 6.5 | 7.2 | 8.0 | 8+ |
| Recognition score | 5.0 | 7.0 | 7.8 | 8+ |
| Voluntary attrition | 15% annual | 12% | 8% | <10% |

### Performance Management adapts for remote:
- OKRs emphasize outcomes, never activity
- 1:1s include "How are you really?" check-in (not just task review)
- Career development conversations quarterly (not just annual review)
- Promotion criteria explicitly remote-friendly (no "presence bias")

## Phase 4: Optimization

### Culture & Engagement identifies and fixes issues:

**Issue found**: India team feels excluded from decisions made during US overlap hours
- **Fix**: Rotate meeting times monthly. Decision artifacts posted async within 2 hours.
- **Result**: India team connection score: 5.8 → 7.5

**Issue found**: New hires feel isolated after buddy program ends (month 3)
- **Fix**: Extend to 6 months. Add cross-team project pairing.
- **Result**: 90-day engagement score: 7.2 → 8.4

**Issue found**: Recognition is manager-dependent — some teams celebrate, others don't
- **Fix**: Peer recognition tool in Slack (#kudos channel + monthly awards)
- **Result**: Recognition score: 5.0 → 7.8
