## Phase 1: Foundation

### Coordinator/Head of People
- Designs org chart: Engineering (8) → Product (3) → Sales (3) → Ops (2)
- Establishes hiring bar: "Would I want this person as my co-founder?"
- Sets weekly hiring cadence: Monday sourcing, Tuesday-Thursday interviews, Friday offers
- Defines culture interview: Every finalist meets 2 founders + 1 team member

### Culture & Engagement
- Documents company values with behavioral examples:
  - **Ownership**: "You see a bug in production, you fix it — even if it's not your code"
  - **Velocity**: "Ship in days, not weeks. Perfect is the enemy of good"
  - **Transparency**: "Bad news travels fast. We share revenue, burn rate, and runway with everyone"
  - **Craft**: "We take pride in our work. Code reviews aren't optional"
- Creates culture deck for candidates (shared during interview process)
- Designs first-week rituals: Monday all-hands, Friday demos, daily async standups

### Performance Management
- Creates career ladder v1: IC1 → IC2 → Senior → Staff → Principal; and Manager → Director → VP
- Defines expectations per level (scope, autonomy, impact)
- Sets 90-day milestones for every role

## Phase 2: Hiring Infrastructure

### Talent Acquisition produces per role:
- **Job descriptions** that lead with mission and challenges, not requirements lists
- **Interview guides** with structured scorecards:
  - Technical screen (45 min): Coding or domain exercise
  - System design / case study (60 min): Architecture or strategy problem
  - Culture interview (30 min): Values alignment with behavioral questions
  - Founder interview (30 min): Mission alignment and mutual evaluation
- **Sourcing strategy**:
  - LinkedIn outreach (personalized, reference company + role context)
  - GitHub/Stack Overflow for engineers (activity-based sourcing)
  - AngelList/Wellfound for startup-minded candidates
  - Referral program: $5K bonus per hire, paid at 90 days

### Compensation & Benefits
- **Salary bands** (75th percentile, SF-adjusted):
  - Senior Engineer: $185K-$210K + 0.15-0.25% equity
  - Engineering Manager: $200K-$230K + 0.25-0.40% equity
  - Product Manager: $170K-$195K + 0.15-0.25% equity
  - Account Executive: $120K base + $120K OTE + 0.10-0.15% equity
- **Benefits package**: Health/dental/vision (company pays 90%), 401K, $2K learning budget, $1K home office stipend
- **Offer philosophy**: Come in strong — don't lowball and negotiate up

### Onboarding & Enablement
- Creates universal Day 1 checklist (accounts, equipment, welcome, orientation)
- Creates role-specific 30/60/90 day plans
- Assigns buddy program: Every new hire paired with tenured team member
- Builds internal wiki with setup guides, architecture docs, team norms

## Phase 3: Execution (Months 1-3)

### Month 1 Target: 4 hires (2 Senior Backend, 1 PM, 1 AE)

**Talent Acquisition pipeline:**
| Role | Sourced | Screened | Interviewed | Offered | Accepted |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Sr Backend #1 | 60 | 12 | 5 | 2 | 1 |
| Sr Backend #2 | 60 | 10 | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Product Manager | 40 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| Account Exec #1 | 50 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 1 |

**Onboarding (first hires):**
- Week 1: Orientation, meet everyone, environment setup, first PR
- Week 2: Paired with buddy, attends all team rituals, first small task
- Week 4: Owns a feature or account, gives first Friday demo

### Month 2 Target: 3 hires (2 Senior Frontend, 1 Product Designer)

Talent Acquisition adjusts:
- Frontend pipeline harder than expected — expand to remote candidates
- Product Designer sourced via Dribbble portfolio reviews
- Referrals start producing: 2 of 3 hires come through team referrals

### Month 3 Target: 3 hires (Engineering Manager, AE #2, Head of Ops)

Senior roles require more touches:
- Engineering Manager: 3 rounds + dinner with founders
- Head of Ops: Coordinator personally recruits from network
- AE #2: Pipeline Manager helps evaluate sales candidates with mock pitch

## Phase 4: Optimization

### Coordinator reviews hiring metrics:
| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Hires completed | 10 | 10 |
| Time to offer (avg) | 21 days | 24 days |
| Offer acceptance rate | 80% | 78% |
| Time to first PR/deliverable | 7 days | 5 days |
| 90-day retention | 100% | 100% |
| Candidate NPS | 8+ | 8.5 |
| Referral hires | 30%+ | 30% |

### Lessons learned:
1. Frontend market is tighter than backend — start sourcing 2 weeks earlier
2. Referral program works best after Month 1 (new hires refer their networks)
3. Culture interview is highest-signal — weight it more in scorecard
4. Offer speed matters: lost 2 candidates to slower offers from competitors

## Cost: ~$78
