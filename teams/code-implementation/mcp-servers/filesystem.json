  "team_integration": "The Filesystem MCP server provides all agents with sandboxed access to the project directory. The Coordinator reads the project structure during Phase 1 planning. Implementation Specialists read existing code for convention matching and write new source files. The Code Reviewer reads source files for context beyond the diff. The Test Engineer writes test files and fixtures. The DevOps Specialist writes Dockerfiles, CI configs, and infrastructure templates. Access is restricted to the PROJECT_ROOT directory to prevent unintended modifications outside the project."
