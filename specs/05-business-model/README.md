# Sforza Business Model

Strategic documentation for Sforza's positioning, monetization, and go-to-market approach. Synthesized from Alex Hormozi's $100M Money Models framework, OpenClaw ecosystem analysis, the $285B SaaS crash, and Conductor v0.34.2 decompilation insights.

## Core Thesis

Sforza is a **general-purpose agent swarm orchestrator** -- a platform primitive -- that ships with templates adapted to many use cases. The product is the **Decision Queue**: agents work autonomously, humans make the calls. Everything else is infrastructure that makes the Decision Queue possible.

## Key Constraints

- **BYOLLM**: Users bring their own Claude subscription or API key. Sforza never intermediates LLM costs.
- **Start with friction, not ambition**: MVP leads with a low-stakes Research Brief template ($5-15), not the full Business Builder.
- **Perfect one offer at a time**: Don't launch the full Money Model simultaneously. Stage I first, then build.
- **Simple scales, fancy fails**: The offer structure must be explainable in one sentence.
