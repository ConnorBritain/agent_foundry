## Vision

Build an AI-powered project management tool for creative agencies (5-50 people) that automates task assignment, deadline tracking, and resource allocation.

## Stage

Pre-seed startup. Solo technical founder with a working prototype. Seeking $500K angel funding within 3 months.

## Execution Strategy

Serial execution with Phase 1 teams running first to establish strategy, followed by execution teams in Phase 2, and go-to-market in Phase 3.
